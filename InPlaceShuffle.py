"""
Write a function for doing an in-place â†´ shuffle of a list.

The shuffle must be "uniform," meaning each item in the original list must have the same probability of ending up in
each spot in the final list.

Assume that you have a function get_random(floor, ceiling) for getting a random integer that is >= floor and <= ceiling.

# This solution is naive because this method doesn't return a uniform solution
# Take for example arr = [A,B,C] we allow 3 indices to swap from 3 choices for 3 calls (3*3*3=27)
# However, there are only 6 possible outcomes for how to arrange [A,B,C] (3!=3*2*1)
# 27 is not evenly divisible 6, so our 6 outcomes will be possible with more sets of choices than others.

# Using the same get_rando() function we generate a better method to shuffling in-place
